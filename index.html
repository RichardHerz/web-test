    <h3>web-test ... experiments in web design for interactive learning</h3>
    <p>
      Experiments with embedding into web pages <b>interactive simulations</b>
      that are useable on both <b>mobile</b> and <b>desktop</b> devices.
      </p>
      <p>
      The objective is to enhance learning by combining "reading" and "doing."
