  <p><b><i>Adiabatic PFR with feed-product heat exchange</i></b> - Web Labs at www.ReactorLab.net - by Richard K. Herz</p>

  <p>
    The system inlet flow enters the "cold side" of a heat exchanger, then
    flows to the inlet of an adiabatic, packed-bed, plug-flow reactor.
    The reaction is first-order in the reactant and essentially irreversible: equilibrium
    conversion is specified to be nearly 100% under all conditions.
    The concentration of reactant A is represented as Ca. Constant fluid density is assumed.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the reaction enthalpy (heat of reaction) is negatively valued, the reaction
    is exothermic and heats the fluid, which tends to increase the reaction
    and energy release rates. The fluid leaving the reactor enters
    the "hot side" of the heat exchanger. For an exothermic reaction, this heats
    the inlet flow. This type of system is related to an "autothermal reactor" in which
    the heat exchanger is integrated with the reactor.
  </p>

  <p>This system has <b>feedback</b> of energy. From the default conditions, change the
    system inlet T to 340 K. Notice the temperature change flow to the right
    in the cold side of the heat exchanger, then from left to right in the reactor,
    then from right to left in the hot side of the exchanger. This the heats
    the cold side again and the process is repeated again.
  </p>

  <p>This system can exbibit <b>hysteresis</b>. Click the Run button and let the system
    reach steady state at the default conditions. Then increase the System inlet T from
    325 K to 330 K and wait for steady state. Note the relatively low conversion of
    reactant to product.
  </p>
  <p>Then increase the inlet T to 340 K and wait for steady state. Finally, decrease the
    inlet T back to the previous 330 K and wait for steady state. Note the
    relatively high conversion of reactant. Thus, there are <b>multiple steady states</b>
    at 330 K.
