did experiment with co-current flow and same inlet T's and got plot showing T propagation down tube but no color change in hot nor cold color canvases

using mixing cells creates a spread in residence time, unlike plug flow

so is similar to axial conduction (not described) or axial dispersion of energy in turbulent fluid (which happens) 

but number of mixing cells that accurately reflect axial dispersion should be estimated by equation - probably a function of Reynolds number 

noticed this with U=0 such that no heat exchange but get spread in fluid T down tube 

SEE THIS REF FOR estimate of Peclet number for turbulent mixing 

https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/che503/chapter%205.pdf  

then see a paper "comparison of tanks-in-series and axial dispersion models for an electrochemical reactor" whose abstract has Pe = 2*(N - 1) 

SHOULD I USE ACTUAL FINITE DIFFERENCE MODEL OF PLUG FLOW WITH A DISPERSION COEFFICIENT RATHER THAN MIXING CELL???
