Parameters from Wu & Chang ie061314j which give self-sustained oscillations

Their g/L should be same as my kg/m3
I can just use my seconds for their hours

Feed conc > 15 g/L
Dilution rate from 0.125 to 0.28 per hour

Below, greek are Wu & Chang for yield equation, English from Alvarez-Ramirez et al.

Vmin (alpha) = 0.01 g/g
a (beta) = 0.03 L/g
p (gamma) = 0.1 g/g

MUmax = 0.3 per hour (for standard Monod equation)
Ks = 1.75 g/L

initial conditions in reactor
biomass (x0) = 1.322 g/L
substrate (s0) = 0.3 g/L
