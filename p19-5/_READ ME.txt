PROBLEM ??? >>> when change biomass feed conc in manual mode the input changes as soon as it's typed without having to click out of field or hit return - whereas when do same in an auto input param, need to click out of field or hit return WHY?  

REASON FOR PROBLEM >> the step function of unit 1 was getting the field value directly 

  this.concNEW = Number(enterFeedConc.value); 
  
rather than getting the command of unit 3

TODO

In the main js script put the setting and sending of the dt value to the units is in a logical place - best if main script can get info about changing accuracy or characteristic times of units...
 
DONE: Choose wording such that any reference to other units that a unit uses (and those that use it) are easily searchable so that they can be changed if unit is used somewhere else, which I have done between my web app experiments. 

DONE: Make it clear in the units that default parameter values - dt (any others?) - can be changed from the main js script.  

CHANGES 

1) change updateInputs to updateUIparams everywhere in three places: index.html, process_main.js, and process_units.js 

this is to differentiate unit inputs from other units (ports) from params changed by user in UI

2) change to get inputs from other units one place at top of function step() in a unit definition, e.g., 

  step	: function(){

    // GET INPUT CONNECTIONS TO THIS UNIT FROM OTHER UNITS
    //   unit_3 USES unit_2.biomass - controlled variable
    biomass = unit_2.biomass; 
    
and then use local variables (biomass here) in all other places in function step() 

3) in main js, in function updateProcess, add this comment

			eval(unitName + '.dt = dt;'); // units use this dt, not their default dt 
			
4) in plotter js, changed x axis label to Time (hr) from Time (s) 

	xaxes: [ { min: 0, max: 180, axisLabel: "Time (hr), 0-180 hr span" } ],
