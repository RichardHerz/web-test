  <p>Test of adding child objects to a parent object.</p>
  <p>This should allow defining process units in separate files,
    then adding them to parent processUnits object.
  </p>
  <p>But does this leave child in memory too?</p>
  <p>I can set it to null after putting into parent, but
  does JS garbage collection free memory?</p>

<script>

    var myParent ={};

    var child01 = {name : 'joe', age : 10};
    var child02 = {name : 'ann', age : 12};

    myParent['child01'] = child01;
    myParent['child02'] = child02;

    alert("myParent['child02']['name'] = " + myParent['child02']['name'] );
    alert("child02['name'] = " + child02['name'] );

    child02 = 0;
    alert("after zeroing, child02['name'] = " + child02['name'] );

</script>
